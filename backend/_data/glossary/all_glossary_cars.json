    "glossary_description": "Antilock braking system is an enhanced braking system that monitors individual wheel rotation and prevents the wheels from locking up while stopping. Locked wheels provide inefficient braking and sacrifice directional control, so ABS shortens stopping distances in most conditions and allows the driver to steer even when panic braking. The federal government began requiring ABS on all new cars starting with the 2012 model year. Pulsation in the brake pedal can startle the uninitiated, but it is a sign of the ABS properly doing its job.  In structure, ABS is similar to a conventional braking system, but its components may need repair, starting with electronic wheel sensors at each wheel or at the differential, the computer brain called the control module, and a valve assembly and pump.",

    "glossary_description": "The ABS control module is a microprocessor that runs diagnostic checks of a vehicle\u2019s antilock braking system and processes information from wheel-speed sensors and the hydraulic brake system to determine when to release braking pressure at a wheel that\u2019s about to lock up and start skidding.  Antilock brakes have been available since the 1980s and are standard on all 2012 model-year and later vehicles because they\u2019re an integral part of electronic stability control, which has been required since 2012. Antilock systems prevent skids when braking, and stability control intervenes to prevent skids even when the brakes aren\u2019t applied.  A dashboard ABS warning light is supposed to come on for a few seconds every time a vehicle is started, but if it comes on while driving it signals that the control module has conked out, a wheel sensor has failed or another problem has developed.  On many vehicles, the brakes should still operate normally when the warning light is on, but the antilock function won\u2019t work. On some vehicles, though, braking ability will be reduced if the antilock system malfunctions, and stability control and traction control (on vehicles with those features) might also be disabled.  An ABS warning light usually triggers a trouble code that can be read with a diagnostic tool to help mechanics pinpoint the problem.",

That means it\u2019s probably time for an A/C recharge, but there\u2019s more to it than just filling \u2019er up.  Because the refrigerant operates in a closed system, the most likely cause for low levels is a leak in the air-conditioning system. The most common practice by repair shops is for a qualified technician to inspect the system for obvious leaks, such as in hoses, pipes or the air-conditioning compressor, and make repairs as necessary.  Can you save money by merely topping off the system with refrigerant? Possibly. Could you even do it yourself? Yes (kits are available from parts stores). But there are a couple of major issues with that approach. There\u2019s no way of knowing how much refrigerant is left in the system, so even a qualified technician would have to guess as to how much to add to top it off. Systems vary, but each one holds a specific amount of refrigerant. The only way to know it\u2019s full is to evacuate the system and fill it with the specified amount.  Secondly, topping off the refrigerant doesn\u2019t fix leaks or whatever other issue caused the system to run low, so it\u2019s only a temporary fix at best. The air conditioner might work for a while, but most systems are designed to shut down once the refrigerant falls to a certain level, and eventually you\u2019ll be back to only warm air.  Small leaks, such as pinholes in hoses, can be hard to find, so the work might not be done even after a complete evacuation and recharge. The air conditioner might stop working after a few days, and when you return to the shop they might have to inject dye into the system and trace it with a black light for leaks, which could be in a hidden location such as the A/C evaporator, which is behind the dashboard.",

    "glossary_description": "The heater blower motor reduces or increases the amount of air blowing through the dashboard vents based on the fan speed selected or, in an automatic climate control system, the interior temperature and other factors. But resistors, small electronic parts tucked out of sight, are what actually control the fan speed by reducing the amount of electrical current going to the blower motor.  When everything is working properly, setting the fan speed at its lowest setting, for example, will tell the resistor to restrict the amount of current to a low level. But if the resistor burns out or wears out from corrosion, there is nothing to reduce the amount of voltage going to the blower motor for the lowest fan speed, so it will most likely get the maximum current and run at full speed.  When a resistor fails, the fan will often run only at higher speeds or the highest speed, no matter what fan speed is selected. In some vehicles, though, the fan may not work at all, and only a little may come through the vents.  If little air is coming through the vents (hot or cold), then it could be because the blower motor for the fan or a switch or resistor that controls fan speed isn\u2019t working. Another cause might be that the electronically controlled \u201cblend doors\u201d that direct air flow are stuck or broken.  The fan switch may be at fault, but a more likely reason is that a blower motor resistor that controls the voltage going to the blower has packed it in, resulting in only one speed remaining operable \u2013 usually the highest speed.  When a blower resistor fails, the highest fan speed usually is the only one that still works because it essentially bypasses the resistor and receives the maximum amount of voltage. When the resistor is working, it reduces the amount of voltage going to the lower fan speeds so the fan runs slower.  Blower resistors are small parts that can become corroded or just burn out, and a new one often costs less than $50. Because they\u2019re usually under the dashboard on the passenger\u2019s side or behind the glove box, near the blower motor, they can be hard to reach if they need to be replaced.  Though having only one fan speed usually indicates a bad blower resistor, diligent mechanics will test the resistor, fan switch and connections to the blower motor to make sure before they start replacing parts. If none of the fan speeds work, then checking the fuse or fuses for the heating, vent and air conditioning systems is a logical first step.",

    "glossary_description": "The radiator is Grand Central Station for an engine\u2019s cooling system: The mixture of antifreeze and water that cools the engine continually passes through the radiator, where it discharges some of the heat it picked up from the engine and takes in cooler air before circulating again through passages around the engine. A spur line sends warm coolant to the heater core to generate heated air for the interior when needed.  A water pump circulates the coolant around the engine, and a thermostatically controlled fan behind the radiator turns on as needed to draw more air through the radiator to help cool the antifreeze/water mixture.  Though most modern radiators are made of aluminum and plastic and are generally thought to be rust-resistant, the metal can still corrode. Antifreeze contains rust inhibitors that break down over time, allowing corrosion to damage cooling fins inside the radiator and rust to eat through from the inside and cause leaks. Some radiators also have plastic parts that can develop cracks and leak.  That is why many vehicle manufacturers recommend changing the engine coolant and flushing the system periodically, though in some cases that isn\u2019t for 100,000 miles or more. Some manufacturers say the coolant never has to be changed and only the coolant level needs to be checked periodically. Repair shops can test coolant for corrosion resistance and for protection against freezing.  Debris such as dirt, leaves and plastic bags can collect on radiators and reduce their cooling ability. Hoses connected to the radiator and radiator caps also can develop leaks, and thermostats that regulate coolant flow can fail. Having a repair shop do a full cooling system inspection should be part of regular maintenance on vehicles more than five years old or that have more than 50,000 miles on the odometer.",

Where it lives is also a factor; although battery failure is most often associated with cold weather, hot temperatures do more to shorten battery life by evaporating the fluid and destroying cells inside the battery.

Batteries store the electrical power that starts the engine and operates accessories, such as the lights, power locks and windows, and the stereo.

    "glossary_description": "Headlamps come in several sizes, shapes and types, as do their bulbs, which need periodic replacing. A majority of vehicles still use halogen headlamp bulbs, but a growing number come with high-intensity-discharge lighting that uses xenon gas instead of a filament, or with a cluster of LED bulbs that have a distinctive white light.\n\nThe different types of bulbs are not usually interchangeable, but aftermarket conversion kits offer the opportunity to switch from halogen to xenon or even to LED, though that typically involves changing the wiring and adding components. Moreover, getting the full benefit of xenon or LED requires having headlamp assemblies designed for that type of bulb.\n\nHalogen bulbs are the cheapest, though more expensive replacements that claim to be brighter, more powerful and able to illuminate more of the road are available. Some of these claims are true, but federal regulations limit how far they can reach down the road. Bulbs legal for highway use can\u2019t be so powerful they\u2019ll blind oncoming drivers.\n\nIn addition, halogen bulbs that claim to be brighter and whiter usually don\u2019t last as long as the original-equipment bulbs that come on new vehicles. Sylvania, for example, says its SilverStar halogen bulbs have an average life of about one year. Original-equipment bulbs are typically the \u201clong-life\u201d type that should last for years.\n\nXenon lights have a whiter color than halogens, with a slight bluish glow that gives them a distinctive appearance. Bulb manufacturers try to capitalize on this by offering halogen replacement bulbs that are tinted blue. Independent tests have shown, however, that these blue-tinted bulbs tend to produce less light, not more, than standard halogens, even though they\u2019re more expensive.\n\nIn addition to being brighter, xenon bulbs use less energy than halogens and last longer, but they\u2019re more expensive to replace and also require ballast that may need periodic replacement.\n\nLEDs are the most expensive type of headlight and generate light through semiconductors. They last longer than other types \u2013 up to 10 years, by some estimates -- and use less energy, which is one reason vehicle manufacturers are switching to them.\n\nThough LED headlamps last longer, replacing them because of an accident or other damage is likely to be more expensive than replacing other types would be.\n\nAs with xenon lights, several companies offer kits to convert halogen systems to LEDs, though these kits often include only one LED bulb that fits into the original socket. LED systems typically use several bulbs arranged in a pattern to generate sufficient lighting, and experts warn that a single LED bulb doesn\u2019t produce as much light as a single halogen and is not a good substitute.",

Metal contacts in the cap connect with contacts in the ignition wires to form an electrical link, and the current is passed along to each spark plug according to its firing order.\n\nThis type of ignition system with a separate ignition coil -- a rotor in a distributor that sends electrical current to each spark plug through wires in the cap -- began to phase out in the 1970s. Most modern ignition systems don\u2019t need a distributor because of advances in electronic controls. They have separate ignition coils for each cylinder that connect directly to the spark plugs or, in some instances, one coil for every two cylinders and short ignition wires from the coils to the spark plugs.",

An injection pump, usually driven by a belt or chain linked to the crankshaft, does this by supplying fuel under high pressure (15,000 pounds per square inch or more) to the injectors for each cylinder.\n\nAs with gasoline engines, diesel injection pumps are controlled by the engine control module in order to deliver the correct amount of fuel at the right time for each cylinder.

An illuminated oil system warning light (usually red with the outline of a vintage oil can) or low-pressure indication on an oil pressure gauge are signs that the oil level is extremely low, the pump is not operating at normal speed or there\u2019s a related problem that needs prompt attention.\n\nWhen a warning light comes on, the best approach is to shut the engine off, wait several minutes and check the oil level.

    "glossary_description": "Most engines operate at roughly 190-210 degrees Fahrenheit, and temperatures inside combustion chambers can reach 4,500 degrees. To keep their cool, engines need a steady and ample supply of coolant (a mixture of antifreeze and water), air and engine oil, plus a well-functioning support team of hoses, a water pump, a radiator and thermostat, plus other components.\n\nIf any part of the cooling system breaks down, an engine can quickly overheat, causing hot metal parts to warp or even seize from heat and friction. Here are some typical causes of overheating:\n\n- Radiators and hoses can develop leaks, so over time there will be too little coolant to circulate throughout the engine and absorb heat.\n\n- Radiators can get blocked by plastic bags, dirt and other debris that restricts the flow of air that\u2019s supposed to cool the coolant as it passes through.\n\n- Thermostatically controlled fans that draw outside air through the radiator can fail.\n\n- A thermostat that\u2019s supposed to open to allow coolant to flow through the radiator may get stuck in the closed position, or the water pump that keeps the coolant flowing around the engine can leak or fail. In either case, the coolant stuck in jackets and passages in the engine will eventually overheat.\n\n- A radiator cap that doesn\u2019t seal tightly lowers the boiling point of the coolant, causing an engine to overheat. Most vehicles are supposed to have a 50-50 mix of antifreeze and water, and if there\u2019s too little antifreeze that also lowers the boiling point.\n\nAmong other problems that can cause overheated engines are failed cylinder head gaskets, which allow coolant to leak into combustion chambers; blocked exhaust systems; \u201cdragging\u201d brakes that don\u2019t release when the pedal is released; and towing or hauling more weight than the cooling system is designed to handle.\n\nThough engine oil is not part of the cooling system, it does perform a cooling function by reducing friction between moving parts. In addition, as it gets pumped around the engine it absorbs some heat. An engine that\u2019s low on oil by a couple of quarts or more will run hotter and could eventually overheat.",

It can be expensive to repair, often $600 or more, because it typically involves removing the transmission and, in some cases, all or part of the engine.\n\nOn most front-wheel-drive vehicles the engine is mounted transversely, so the rear of the engine is the end opposite the one with the pulleys and drive accessory belt. An oil leak from the main seal, also known as the rear crankshaft seal, will usually drip from where the transmission connects to the engine, though it may show up elsewhere, such as on the oil pan.\n\nRear main seals can be made of rubber or silicone, and they can wear out because of age, the rotational forces of the crankshaft, corrosion from road salt and other environmental factors.\n\nThe traditional fix for a leaking main seal is to replace it, but because of the typically high labor cost some vehicle owners use oil additives designed to restore seals. In some cases, that can stop or slow leaks. Other drivers may switch to a heavier oil, such as 10W30 instead of 5W20. Mechanics frequently advise that when a transmission has to be removed for any reason, that\u2019s a good time to replace the rear main seal, even if it isn\u2019t leaking, because much of the disassembly work involved will already be done.",

The thermostat is typically located where the upper radiator hose enters the engine.\n\nThermostat replacement usually isn\u2019t listed in vehicle maintenance schedules, and some mechanics advise that as long as it\u2019s working there\u2019s no need to replace it. On the other hand, if the coolant is being flushed at, say, 100,000 miles, or radiator hoses are being replaced, many repair shops will suggest replacing the thermostat at the same time.",

The throttle body resembles the base of a carburetor, and some low-cost fuel-injection systems had one or two injectors inside the throttle body instead of an injector for each cylinder, and that was where air mixed with fuel. On multi-point injection systems, with one or more injectors for each cylinder, only air passes through the throttle body.\n\nMany drivers think \u201cwide-open throttle\u201d means flooring the gas pedal. That\u2019s correct, but flooring the pedal opens a throttle blade as wide as it can go, allowing more air into the engine. When more air goes in, more gas (or diesel) goes into the engine with it, producing more power and speed. Dirt can build up in a throttle body and cause sluggish acceleration, hard starting or stalling, so the body needs to be cleaned as part of fuel system maintenance.",

    "glossary_description": "Part of a rack-and-pinion steering system, the rack is a bar parallel to the front axle that moves left or right when the steering wheel is turned, aiming the front wheels in the correct direction. The pinion is a small gear at the end of the vehicle\u2019s steering column that engages the rack.\n\nThough steering racks are hearty, they sometimes require replacement. Signs of a failing rack include difficulty turning the steering wheel in one direction but not the other, jerkiness of motion or noises.",

    "glossary_description": "Officially a MacPherson strut, named after its creator, a strut is a type of shock absorber that has a structural role in a vehicle\u2019s suspension. The strut includes a shock absorber element, but it also serves to position the wheels, a task handled by control arms in a conventional suspension design that employs dedicated shock absorbers.\n\nLike shocks, struts can lose their ability to damp bounces and compromise the car\u2019s roadholding and braking. Mechanics might spot oil leaking from the strut, which means the component is on its way out and should be replaced. Uneven tire wear is another potential sign that the shock-absorber component is failing. Because of their size and complexity, struts are more expensive to replace than shock absorbers.",

    "glossary_description": "On many vehicles with strut-type suspension designs, the front struts (which include the springs and shock absorbers) are mounted with bearings or bearing plates that serve as the upper pivot points for the steering.\n\nThe bearings can wear out from long-term use, corrosion, impact or collision damage, and other factors. When they do, they often make knocking or clunking noises over bumps or in turns, or the steering becomes stiff or snaps back toward center when the driver lets go of the steering wheel. Bad strut bearings can also cause alignment issues and uneven tire wear.\n\nMany mechanics recommend that strut bearings be replaced whenever struts are replaced so worn bearings don\u2019t affect suspension or steering performance. Some replacement parts come as a complete assembly with struts, springs, bearing plates and mounting hardware. In addition, strut assemblies should be replaced in pairs, not just one side at a time, and the vehicle should also get a wheel alignment after the struts and/or bearing plates are replaced.\n\nOne advantage of buying a complete strut assembly instead of individual parts is that with the complete kit, removing and installing the strut assembly doesn\u2019t require a spring compressor, a tool that can cause serious injury when not used properly.",
