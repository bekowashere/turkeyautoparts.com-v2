Regulated by the engine ECU, special solenoid valves control the amount of fuel being injected in each cylinder.

Unlike a normal transmission, which effectively has to choose between a given number of planetary gears, the CVT just varies the diameter of the conical inner surfaces on which the steel/rubber belt rides. \n\nMost of them use either hydraulic pressure or spring tension to adjust the distance between the two pulleys. The main advantage of CVTs over conventional transmissions resides in their smoothness, since basically there is no interruption of power during the \"shifting\" maneuver. The main shortcoming is the amount of torque they can handle, which depends strictly to the material of which the belt is being made of. This can be neglected to a certain amount by designs which are using more complicated roller arrangements instead of belts and pulleys. \n\n",

    "glossary_description": "Originally developed for aircraft braking systems in the first half of the twentieth century, the Antilock Braking System (ABS) is essentially used to improve stability during braking and in some cases it can even shorten braking distances altogether. Appearing in various mechanical forms before, the first modern electronic four-wheel ABS system was co-developed by Mercedes-Benz and Bosch.\n\nIn cars without ABS, during hard braking the wheels lock, thus making impossible for the car to be steered and the vehicle most likely skids into the obstacle the driver is trying to avoid.  The ABS prevents wheel lock-up during braking maneuvers by using sensors which can determine if any wheel is slowing down more than the others and computer-controlled valves which can limit the pressure delivered to each brake cylinder on demand. The whole system is controlled via a master ECU (Electronic Control Unit). \n\nSince the ABS constantly pumps the brakes during a braking maneuver the driver can concentrate on steering the car while applying constant pressure on the brake pedal, without fear of losing control of the car's direction. Also, while braking on uneven surfaces (left tires on gravel and right ones on tarmac, for example) the ABS can keep the car's stability under control. \nAntilock braking system is an enhanced braking system that monitors individual wheel rotation and prevents the wheels from locking up while stopping. Locked wheels provide inefficient braking and sacrifice directional control, so ABS shortens stopping distances in most conditions and allows the driver to steer even when panic braking. The federal government began requiring ABS on all new cars starting with the 2012 model year. Pulsation in the brake pedal can startle the uninitiated, but it is a sign of the ABS properly doing its job.  In structure, ABS is similar to a conventional braking system, but its components may need repair, starting with electronic wheel sensors at each wheel or at the differential, the computer brain called the control module, and a valve assembly and pump.",

Antilock brakes have been available since the 1980s and are standard on all 2012 model-year and later vehicles because they\u2019re an integral part of electronic stability control, which has been required since 2012. Antilock systems prevent skids when braking, and stability control intervenes to prevent skids even when the brakes aren\u2019t applied.  A dashboard ABS warning light is supposed to come on for a few seconds every time a vehicle is started, but if it comes on while driving it signals that the control module has conked out, a wheel sensor has failed or another problem has developed.  On many vehicles, the brakes should still operate normally when the warning light is on, but the antilock function won\u2019t work. On some vehicles, though, braking ability will be reduced if the antilock system malfunctions, and stability control and traction control (on vehicles with those features) might also be disabled.  An ABS warning light usually triggers a trouble code that can be read with a diagnostic tool to help mechanics pinpoint the problem.",

    "glossary_description": "When your air conditioner blows only mildly cool air or no cool air at all, it\u2019s probably low on refrigerant, the gas that many people still refer to as \u201cFreon\u201d but which now is a different substance, R-134, that\u2019s less damaging to the environment. That means it\u2019s probably time for an A/C recharge, but there\u2019s more to it than just filling \u2019er up.  Because the refrigerant operates in a closed system, the most likely cause for low levels is a leak in the air-conditioning system. The most common practice by repair shops is for a qualified technician to inspect the system for obvious leaks, such as in hoses, pipes or the air-conditioning compressor, and make repairs as necessary.  Can you save money by merely topping off the system with refrigerant? Possibly. Could you even do it yourself? Yes (kits are available from parts stores). But there are a couple of major issues with that approach. There\u2019s no way of knowing how much refrigerant is left in the system, so even a qualified technician would have to guess as to how much to add to top it off. Systems vary, but each one holds a specific amount of refrigerant. The only way to know it\u2019s full is to evacuate the system and fill it with the specified amount.  Secondly, topping off the refrigerant doesn\u2019t fix leaks or whatever other issue caused the system to run low, so it\u2019s only a temporary fix at best. The air conditioner might work for a while, but most systems are designed to shut down once the refrigerant falls to a certain level, and eventually you\u2019ll be back to only warm air.  Small leaks, such as pinholes in hoses, can be hard to find, so the work might not be done even after a complete evacuation and recharge. The air conditioner might stop working after a few days, and when you return to the shop they might have to inject dye into the system and trace it with a black light for leaks, which could be in a hidden location such as the A/C evaporator, which is behind the dashboard.",

    "glossary_description": "The heater blower motor reduces or increases the amount of air blowing through the dashboard vents based on the fan speed selected or, in an automatic climate control system, the interior temperature and other factors. But resistors, small electronic parts tucked out of sight, are what actually control the fan speed by reducing the amount of electrical current going to the blower motor.  When everything is working properly, setting the fan speed at its lowest setting, for example, will tell the resistor to restrict the amount of current to a low level. But if the resistor burns out or wears out from corrosion, there is nothing to reduce the amount of voltage going to the blower motor for the lowest fan speed, so it will most likely get the maximum current and run at full speed.  When a resistor fails, the fan will often run only at higher speeds or the highest speed, no matter what fan speed is selected. In some vehicles, though, the fan may not work at all, and only a little may come through the vents.  If little air is coming through the vents (hot or cold), then it could be because the blower motor for the fan or a switch or resistor that controls fan speed isn\u2019t working. Another cause might be that the electronically controlled \u201cblend doors\u201d that direct air flow are stuck or broken.  The fan switch may be at fault, but a more likely reason is that a blower motor resistor that controls the voltage going to the blower has packed it in, resulting in only one speed remaining operable \u2013 usually the highest speed.  When a blower resistor fails, the highest fan speed usually is the only one that still works because it essentially bypasses the resistor and receives the maximum amount of voltage. When the resistor is working, it reduces the amount of voltage going to the lower fan speeds so the fan runs slower.  Blower resistors are small parts that can become corroded or just burn out, and a new one often costs less than $50. Because they\u2019re usually under the dashboard on the passenger\u2019s side or behind the glove box, near the blower motor, they can be hard to reach if they need to be replaced.  Though having only one fan speed usually indicates a bad blower resistor, diligent mechanics will test the resistor, fan switch and connections to the blower motor to make sure before they start replacing parts. If none of the fan speeds work, then checking the fuse or fuses for the heating, vent and air conditioning systems is a logical first step.",

A spur line sends warm coolant to the heater core to generate heated air for the interior when needed.  A water pump circulates the coolant around the engine, and a thermostatically controlled fan behind the radiator turns on as needed to draw more air through the radiator to help cool the antifreeze/water mixture.  Though most modern radiators are made of aluminum and plastic and are generally thought to be rust-resistant, the metal can still corrode. Antifreeze contains rust inhibitors that break down over time, allowing corrosion to damage cooling fins inside the radiator and rust to eat through from the inside and cause leaks. Some radiators also have plastic parts that can develop cracks and leak.  That is why many vehicle manufacturers recommend changing the engine coolant and flushing the system periodically, though in some cases that isn\u2019t for 100,000 miles or more. Some manufacturers say the coolant never has to be changed and only the coolant level needs to be checked periodically. Repair shops can test coolant for corrosion resistance and for protection against freezing.  Debris such as dirt, leaves and plastic bags can collect on radiators and reduce their cooling ability. Hoses connected to the radiator and radiator caps also can develop leaks, and thermostats that regulate coolant flow can fail. Having a repair shop do a full cooling system inspection should be part of regular maintenance on vehicles more than five years old or that have more than 50,000 miles on the odometer.",

A differential is also the component through which a rotating driveshaft can change direction; for example, in a rear-wheel-drive car whose driveshaft runs the length of the car, it joins and transfers its power to an axle that runs perpendicular to the car to drive the left and right wheels.  Differentials are low-maintenance, sealed components that are expected to last the life of the vehicle but may have a recommended service interval to check and/or replace the oil. Note that a car with four-wheel drive can have two or more differentials. A failing differential can cause vibration, binding during turns and/or sounds ranging from clunking to howling.",

Over time, a battery\u2019s capacity to store electricity will diminish, or it will suffer physical damage such as a cracked case.\n\nHow soon a battery needs replacing depends on a number of factors, such as the number of times it\u2019s used to start the engine. Where it lives is also a factor; although battery failure is most often associated with cold weather, hot temperatures do more to shorten battery life by evaporating the fluid and destroying cells inside the battery. Whereas a battery might last three to five years in the Northeast, it could need replacing sooner in Arizona or Florida.\n\nBatteries frequently get blamed for all sorts of electrical issues, but they\u2019re only one part of a car\u2019s charging system. Batteries store the electrical power that starts the engine and operates accessories, such as the lights, power locks and windows, and the stereo. The battery depends on the alternator to generate electricity and a voltage regulator to control the amount of electricity generated. If either of those components becomes worn or fails, the battery won\u2019t be fully charged and able to do its part.\n\nThat\u2019s why it pays it have the entire charging system checked before replacing a battery to make sure the problem isn\u2019t somewhere else. Many parts stores (as well as repair shops) will check a battery\u2019s state of charge and reserve capacity for free, but just replacing the battery won\u2019t fix problems caused by the alternator, voltage regulator, or damaged electrical connectors or cables, or if the belt that drives the alternator is loose or worn.",

    "glossary_description": "Headlamps come in several sizes, shapes and types, as do their bulbs, which need periodic replacing. A majority of vehicles still use halogen headlamp bulbs, but a growing number come with high-intensity-discharge lighting that uses xenon gas instead of a filament, or with a cluster of LED bulbs that have a distinctive white light.\n\nThe different types of bulbs are not usually interchangeable, but aftermarket conversion kits offer the opportunity to switch from halogen to xenon or even to LED, though that typically involves changing the wiring and adding components. Moreover, getting the full benefit of xenon or LED requires having headlamp assemblies designed for that type of bulb.\n\nHalogen bulbs are the cheapest, though more expensive replacements that claim to be brighter, more powerful and able to illuminate more of the road are available. Some of these claims are true, but federal regulations limit how far they can reach down the road. Bulbs legal for highway use can\u2019t be so powerful they\u2019ll blind oncoming drivers.\n\nIn addition, halogen bulbs that claim to be brighter and whiter usually don\u2019t last as long as the original-equipment bulbs that come on new vehicles. Sylvania, for example, says its SilverStar halogen bulbs have an average life of about one year. Original-equipment bulbs are typically the \u201clong-life\u201d type that should last for years.\n\nXenon lights have a whiter color than halogens, with a slight bluish glow that gives them a distinctive appearance. Bulb manufacturers try to capitalize on this by offering halogen replacement bulbs that are tinted blue. Independent tests have shown, however, that these blue-tinted bulbs tend to produce less light, not more, than standard halogens, even though they\u2019re more expensive.\n\nIn addition to being brighter, xenon bulbs use less energy than halogens and last longer, but they\u2019re more expensive to replace and also require ballast that may need periodic replacement.\n\nLEDs are the most expensive type of headlight and generate light through semiconductors. They last longer than other types \u2013 up to 10 years, by some estimates -- and use less energy, which is one reason vehicle manufacturers are switching to them.\n\nThough LED headlamps last longer, replacing them because of an accident or other damage is likely to be more expensive than replacing other types would be.\n\nAs with xenon lights, several companies offer kits to convert halogen systems to LEDs, though these kits often include only one LED bulb that fits into the original socket. LED systems typically use several bulbs arranged in a pattern to generate sufficient lighting, and experts warn that a single LED bulb doesn\u2019t produce as much light as a single halogen and is not a good substitute.",

Those could also be signs of other problems, such as a failed starter motor or a dead battery.\n\nAnother potential issue is that a heavy key ring can cause wear on the lock cylinder and the ignition switch, allowing the switch to turn to the Off position when a car hits a bump or pothole, disabling the power-steering, air bags and other systems. That\u2019s what led to General Motors recalling 2.6 million vehicles in 2014 to replace the ignition switch, lock cylinder and keys.",

The oil pump provides the force that delivers oil through galleries and passages around the engine.\n\nOil pumps are usually either inside the oil pan and driven by a camshaft or outside the pan and driven by a crankshaft. When those engine parts start moving, the pump starts working at the same time to pump oil to reduce friction and wear between moving parts and prevent the engine from seizing. If an oil pump stops working, or there is little or no oil because of leaks, engine parts can overheat in a matter of seconds and seize from a lack of lubrication.\n\nChecking or replacing an oil pump is not part of routine service or maintenance, but because it\u2019s critical to an engine any warning signs should be addressed immediately. An illuminated oil system warning light (usually red with the outline of a vintage oil can) or low-pressure indication on an oil pressure gauge are signs that the oil level is extremely low, the pump is not operating at normal speed or there\u2019s a related problem that needs prompt attention.\n\nWhen a warning light comes on, the best approach is to shut the engine off, wait several minutes and check the oil level. If the oil level is normal and the warning light comes on again when the engine is restarted, continuing to run the engine increases the risk of major damage.",

    "glossary_description": "Most engines operate at roughly 190-210 degrees Fahrenheit, and temperatures inside combustion chambers can reach 4,500 degrees. To keep their cool, engines need a steady and ample supply of coolant (a mixture of antifreeze and water), air and engine oil, plus a well-functioning support team of hoses, a water pump, a radiator and thermostat, plus other components.\n\nIf any part of the cooling system breaks down, an engine can quickly overheat, causing hot metal parts to warp or even seize from heat and friction. Here are some typical causes of overheating:\n\n- Radiators and hoses can develop leaks, so over time there will be too little coolant to circulate throughout the engine and absorb heat.\n\n- Radiators can get blocked by plastic bags, dirt and other debris that restricts the flow of air that\u2019s supposed to cool the coolant as it passes through.\n\n- Thermostatically controlled fans that draw outside air through the radiator can fail.\n\n- A thermostat that\u2019s supposed to open to allow coolant to flow through the radiator may get stuck in the closed position, or the water pump that keeps the coolant flowing around the engine can leak or fail. In either case, the coolant stuck in jackets and passages in the engine will eventually overheat.\n\n- A radiator cap that doesn\u2019t seal tightly lowers the boiling point of the coolant, causing an engine to overheat. Most vehicles are supposed to have a 50-50 mix of antifreeze and water, and if there\u2019s too little antifreeze that also lowers the boiling point.\n\nAmong other problems that can cause overheated engines are failed cylinder head gaskets, which allow coolant to leak into combustion chambers; blocked exhaust systems; \u201cdragging\u201d brakes that don\u2019t release when the pedal is released; and towing or hauling more weight than the cooling system is designed to handle.\n\nThough engine oil is not part of the cooling system, it does perform a cooling function by reducing friction between moving parts. In addition, as it gets pumped around the engine it absorbs some heat. An engine that\u2019s low on oil by a couple of quarts or more will run hotter and could eventually overheat.",

It can be expensive to repair, often $600 or more, because it typically involves removing the transmission and, in some cases, all or part of the engine.\n\nOn most front-wheel-drive vehicles the engine is mounted transversely, so the rear of the engine is the end opposite the one with the pulleys and drive accessory belt. An oil leak from the main seal, also known as the rear crankshaft seal, will usually drip from where the transmission connects to the engine, though it may show up elsewhere, such as on the oil pan.\n\nRear main seals can be made of rubber or silicone, and they can wear out because of age, the rotational forces of the crankshaft, corrosion from road salt and other environmental factors.\n\nThe traditional fix for a leaking main seal is to replace it, but because of the typically high labor cost some vehicle owners use oil additives designed to restore seals. In some cases, that can stop or slow leaks. Other drivers may switch to a heavier oil, such as 10W30 instead of 5W20. Mechanics frequently advise that when a transmission has to be removed for any reason, that\u2019s a good time to replace the rear main seal, even if it isn\u2019t leaking, because much of the disassembly work involved will already be done.",

If a thermostat is stuck in the closed position, the engine could overheat because coolant isn\u2019t circulating through the radiator and shedding some heat. In either case, the thermostat should be replaced.\n\nEven if the thermostat opens and closes when it\u2019s supposed to, the housing gasket could develop a leak and need replacing.

On the other hand, if the coolant is being flushed at, say, 100,000 miles, or radiator hoses are being replaced, many repair shops will suggest replacing the thermostat at the same time.",

That\u2019s correct, but flooring the pedal opens a throttle blade as wide as it can go, allowing more air into the engine. When more air goes in, more gas (or diesel) goes into the engine with it, producing more power and speed.

    "glossary_description": "The manifold absolute pressure sensor reads the amount of pressure or vacuum (also called \u201cengine load\u201d) in the intake manifold, where outside air is divvied up in proper amounts and distributed to each cylinder. This pressure reading is shared with the engine control module to determine how much fuel needs to be fed to each cylinder, as well as to determine ignition timing.\n\nA fully functioning MAP sensor is necessary to maintain the right combination of acceleration, fuel economy, emissions and engine smoothness. When the throttle is wide open and air is rushing into the intake manifold (causing a drop in pressure), the MAP sensor signals the engine computer to send more fuel. When the throttle closes, pressure rises and readings from the MAP sensor tell the computer to reduce the amount of fuel going into the engine.\n\nA faulty MAP sensor will usually trigger a \u201ccheck engine\u201d warning light. Other signs of a bad MAP sensor include rough idling, sluggish acceleration or hesitation, poor fuel economy or black smoke coming out the exhaust. Not only can the sensor fail, but vacuum hoses can develop leaks or electrical contacts can fail, triggering the warning light or causing other issues.\n\nSome vehicles use a mass air flow sensor instead of a MAP sensor to measure the amount of air going to the intake manifold.",

In addition to the spark plugs that spark in the combustion chambers, the ignition system consists of an ignition coil, which converts battery voltage to higher voltage, and the spark plug wires that join these components.\n\nAdvancements have greatly reduced the need for ignition system service. Where distributor caps and rotors once needed replacement, electronic ignitions typically keep on firing. In new vehicles, spark-plug replacement intervals are often around 100,000 miles. Spark plug wires still require attention and occasional replacement, though an individual coil-on-plug eliminates those wires entirely.",

When they do, they often make knocking or clunking noises over bumps or in turns, or the steering becomes stiff or snaps back toward center when the driver lets go of the steering wheel. Bad strut bearings can also cause alignment issues and uneven tire wear.\n\nMany mechanics recommend that strut bearings be replaced whenever struts are replaced so worn bearings don\u2019t affect suspension or steering performance. Some replacement parts come as a complete assembly with struts, springs, bearing plates and mounting hardware. In addition, strut assemblies should be replaced in pairs, not just one side at a time, and the vehicle should also get a wheel alignment after the struts and/or bearing plates are replaced.\n\nOne advantage of buying a complete strut assembly instead of individual parts is that with the complete kit, removing and installing the strut assembly doesn\u2019t require a spring compressor, a tool that can cause serious injury when not used properly.",
