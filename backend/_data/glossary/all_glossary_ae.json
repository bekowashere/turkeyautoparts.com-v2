Appearing in various mechanical forms before, the first modern electronic four-wheel ABS system was co-developed by Mercedes-Benz and Bosch.\n\nIn cars without ABS, during hard braking the wheels lock, thus making impossible for the car to be steered and the vehicle most likely skids into the obstacle the driver is trying to avoid.  The ABS prevents wheel lock-up during braking maneuvers by using sensors which can determine if any wheel is slowing down more than the others and computer-controlled valves which can limit the pressure delivered to each brake cylinder on demand. The whole system is controlled via a master ECU (Electronic Control Unit). \n\nSince the ABS constantly pumps the brakes during a braking maneuver the driver can concentrate on steering the car while applying constant pressure on the brake pedal, without fear of losing control of the car's direction. Also, while braking on uneven surfaces (left tires on gravel and right ones on tarmac, for example) the ABS can keep the car's stability under control. \n",

    "glossary_description": "The airbag is also called a \"Supplementary Restraint System\", and in short it consists of an inflatable bag or envelope which keeps the occupants from hitting any hard parts of the vehicle's interior during a crash. In case of a collision, cars equipped with airbags give a much better chance of survival for its occupants, but ONLY when seat belts are worn - hence the \"supplementary\" part. \n\nThe way it works is pretty simple in theory: in case of a sudden deceleration (such as a crash) accelerometers within the car's body trigger the ignition of a gas generator propellant to inflate a nylon fabric bag very rapidly (under 1 tenth of a second). The airbag has small vent holes on its side in order to allow the propellant gas to be slowly expelled from it just as the occupant pushes against the bag.\n\nMost airbag equipped vehicles have several accelerometers and/or gyroscopic sensors to help sense various types of impacts. The different signals from these sensors are fed into a microcomputer which can determine the angle of impact and even the severity of the collision taking place. Depending on the result of these calculations, the airbags ECU will decide if the airbag deployment is necessary or not.\n\n",

Regulated by the engine ECU, special solenoid valves control the amount of fuel being injected in each cylinder.

Unlike a normal transmission, which effectively has to choose between a given number of planetary gears, the CVT just varies the diameter of the conical inner surfaces on which the steel/rubber belt rides. \n\nMost of them use either hydraulic pressure or spring tension to adjust the distance between the two pulleys. The main advantage of CVTs over conventional transmissions resides in their smoothness, since basically there is no interruption of power during the \"shifting\" maneuver. The main shortcoming is the amount of torque they can handle, which depends strictly to the material of which the belt is being made of. This can be neglected to a certain amount by designs which are using more complicated roller arrangements instead of belts and pulleys. \n\n",
